# YGI Holiday Homes Admin Panel

Admin panel for managing properties on the YGI Holiday Homes website.

## Features

- 🔐 Secure login authentication
- 📋 List all properties
- ➕ Add new properties
- ✏️ Edit existing properties
- 🗑️ Delete properties
- 📊 Dashboard overview

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables (optional):
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
# For production (Railway backend):
VITE_API_URL=https://ygiholidayhomes-production.up.railway.app

# For local development:
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

**Note**: By default, the admin panel is configured to use the Railway backend at `https://ygiholidayhomes-production.up.railway.app`. If you're running the backend locally, create a `.env` file with `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`.

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to the admin panel URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Default Login

⚠️ **Important**: Change the default password in production by setting the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable in the backend.
